A game made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 42nd game jam. Written in Java, uses LibGDX as game engine and BFXR for sounds.
Theme was "running out of space".

"Earthâ€™s overpopulation crisis has led humanity to flee to Mars.
You are tasked with managing a colony on the red planet and dealing with the constant influx of colonists. 
Be warned, the mass exodus from Earth is unsustainable and you will inevitably run out of space.
Your goal is to survive as long as possible."

Each building type gives oxygen, food, production, power, or housing. Each turn avaiable housing decreases by one as population increases. 
Buildings which provide housing require 1 food and 1 oxygen. All buildings require 1 power. Buildings cost 10 production to be built.
